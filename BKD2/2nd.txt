-- We are creating a backend and we are using the data from backend in frontend.

-> Javascript has two types to import a file :- synchrinous and asynchronous, require is sync and import is async.
-> If we use asynchronous then we got error and to resolve that error we write {"type" : "module"} in package.json

-> To read of messy json content we can use JSON Formatter online to see JSON in tree form.
