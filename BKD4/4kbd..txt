-> 1st we are making ecommerce data model:-
-> To model nay data first need to think which data is indepandent and unique, it should be prior. Then we should see which data model is 
    dependent on each other, then we should implement them. We have to give references in model of each others.
-> We made user model, then category model then product model.
-> In product model we have to store image of product, MongoDB is powerful enough to store image in database in {Buffer Format}.
    - But we should not store buffer file like :- pdf, images and videos in Database because It make Database heavier. Therefore Database not
    made to store buffer files.
    - So basically these files stored on server on different folder and the public url of the folder used in database.
    - Or We use third party service like :- aws, cloudnery. We store the files on these services and they gave url with respect to the file
    and we stored that url in database.
    - It is possible that the file or image have multiple variants therefore the type of data can be array as well.
